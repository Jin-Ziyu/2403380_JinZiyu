    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a Robotics Systems student at the Singapore Institute of Technology, with a strong foundation in electronics, automation, and robotics. Throughout my academic journey and professional experience, I have cultivated a passion for solving complex technical challenges and driving process improvements in quality assurance and automation.

During my role as an Assistant Quality Assurance Engineer at Kinergy Corporation, I gained valuable hands-on experience in equipment inspections. I worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure product quality and streamline operations. My internship in supply chain management at Wizlogix provided me with further insight into optimizing operations and maintaining accurate inventory control.

My studies and experiences have equipped me with a wide range of skills in electronics, robotics, and process improvement. I am always eager to learn more and apply my knowledge in real-world projects.

I am open to connecting and exploring career opportunities, particularly in robotics, automation, and quality engineering. Let’s chat about how we can collaborate to drive innovation and success.
