    <p>I am Jin Ziyu, a Robotics Systems student at the Singapore Institute of Technology, with a strong foundation in electronics, automation, and robotics. Throughout my academic journey and professional experience, I have cultivated a passion for solving complex technical challenges and driving process improvements in quality assurance and automation.</p>
    <p>During my role as an Assistant Quality Assurance Engineer at Kinergy Corporation, I gained valuable hands-on experience in equipment inspections. I worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure product quality and streamline operations. My internship in supply chain management at Wizlogix provided me with further insight into optimizing operations and maintaining accurate inventory control.</p>
    <p>My studies and experiences have equipped me with a wide range of skills in electronics, robotics, and process improvement. I am always eager to learn more and apply my knowledge in real-world projects.</p>
    <p>I am open to connecting and exploring career opportunities, particularly in robotics, automation, and quality engineering. Let‚Äôs chat about how we can collaborate to drive innovation and success.</p>
